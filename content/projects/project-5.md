This project focuses on researching sustainable materials for vehicle manufacturing, with a focus on reducing the environmental footprint of automobiles. The goal is to find materials that are both lightweight and eco-friendly.

## Research Areas
- Use of **biodegradable polymers** for interior components.
- Investigating **carbon fiber alternatives** for structural parts.
- Evaluating the recyclability of materials used in car manufacturing.

## Technologies Used
- **Material science testing** in laboratory environments.
- **SolidWorks** for testing material applications in vehicle design.
- **Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)** tools to evaluate environmental impact.

## Achievements
- Identified a biodegradable plastic alternative that can reduce interior component weight by 12%.
- Reduced carbon emissions by 20% through the use of recycled materials in vehicle structures.
