This project focuses on the design and development of an electric vehicle (EV) aimed at urban transportation. The main objective is to create a cost-effective, energy-efficient solution that meets the needs of daily commuters while minimizing environmental impact.

## Key Objectives
- Design an aerodynamic body to reduce drag and enhance energy efficiency.
- Utilize lightweight materials to reduce the vehicleâ€™s overall weight.
- Implement a regenerative braking system for extended battery life.

## Technologies Used
- **SolidWorks** for 3D modeling
- **MATLAB** for vehicle dynamics simulation
- **Lithium-ion battery technology**

## Achievements
- Reduced drag coefficient by 15% through advanced aerodynamic modeling.
- Achieved a projected range of 250 km on a single charge with our design.
