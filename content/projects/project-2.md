This project focuses on developing a semi-autonomous driving system that enhances safety and driving comfort. The system aims to assist drivers with functions like adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping, and automatic parking.

## Key Features
- **Adaptive Cruise Control**: Automatically adjusts vehicle speed to maintain safe following distances.
- **Lane Keeping Assist**: Ensures the vehicle stays within lane markings using cameras and sensors.
- **Automated Parking System**: Helps drivers park efficiently in tight spaces.

## Technologies Used
- **Python** and **C++** for AI programming and integration.
- **OpenCV** for real-time image processing and lane detection.
- **LiDAR** and **Radar sensors** for accurate object detection.

## Achievements
- Successfully integrated an object detection system that reacts to obstacles in under 0.5 seconds.
- Achieved a 90% success rate in autonomous parallel parking tests.
