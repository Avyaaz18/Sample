This project focuses on improving vehicle aerodynamics through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis. The goal is to reduce air resistance and improve fuel efficiency or battery life for electric vehicles.

## Key Focus Areas
- Design optimization of the car body for airflow management.
- Simulating airflow around the vehicle to reduce drag and turbulence.
- Testing different spoilers, diffusers, and airflow channels.

## Technologies Used
- **ANSYS Fluent** for CFD simulations.
- **SolidWorks** for designing the vehicle body.
- **Python** for automating simulations and data analysis.

## Achievements
- Reduced vehicle drag by 18%, leading to a projected 10% improvement in fuel efficiency.
- Validated simulation results through wind tunnel testing.
